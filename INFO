## Remote proto


* https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Overview.html#Overview
* Remote protocol ma checksume "$<odpowiedz>#<checksuma>"
* Ale jest "noackmode": https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/8b91f9ce09bbb53ec103ec91583cea5f42f165c0/gdbserver/remote-utils.cc#L983-L997
* Chyba mozna go wlaczyc wysylajac pakiet `QStartNoAckMode` (GDBServer taki odbiera):
```
getpkt ("QStartNoAckMode");  [sending ack]
[sent ack]
[noack mode enabled]
```

## Co powoduje ze nie mozemy `info proc mappings`?

* w przypadku gdbserver gdb wysyla `qXfer:exec-file:read:168b4:0,1000` i dostaje zwrotke z sciezka do pliku
